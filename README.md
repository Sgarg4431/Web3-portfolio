Decentralize Portfolio
Decentralize Portfolio is a decentralized application (DApp) built on the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to create and manage their digital portfolios. This project aims to provide a secure, transparent, and censorship-resistant platform for individuals to showcase their work and accomplishments.

Features
Portfolio Creation: Users can create their digital portfolios by adding details about their projects, skills, education, experience, and more.
Project Showcase: Users can showcase their projects, including descriptions, images, links, and other relevant information.
Skills and Experience: Users can highlight their skills and experience in their portfolios.
Education and Certifications: Users can add details about their education background and certifications.
Decentralized Storage: The portfolio data is stored on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring data integrity, immutability, and resistance to censorship.
Metamask Integration: Users can connect their Ethereum wallets using Metamask to interact with the DApp on desktop as well as mobile.
